## Allah Is Watching Me
Assalamu Aleykum my fellow Muslim brothers and sister. I made this app to help you and me be 
aware of **Allah's presence**. In this modern age, we spend most of our time on our devices 
especially on our computers to work. So, while we work, we are prone to some bad things 
from different platforms. This app will help us to be aware of Allah's presence and as a 
result it will help us avoid looking, watching, or listening to things that are prohibited 
in Islam.
<br/>
<br/>
It is a simple app. It is transparent. It will just show the text "**اللّٰه is watching me**" on the screen, and you can adjust the size and move it around. It will start on your computer startup. It will always be on
top of all other windows. I will try to keep it updated with new features and bug fixes. Also, I am always open
to suggestions or contributions.
